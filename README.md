Q.	Introduce the selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub (with the data source URL) and describe its potential applications and values.

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/the-depression-dataset]
The dataset contains values like timestamp (one minute intervals), date (date of measurement), activity (activity measurement from the actigraph watch).Also,there are patient identifier, days (number of days of measurements), gender (1 or 2 for female or male), age (age in age groups),marriage (1: married or cohabiting, 2: single), work (1: working or studying, 2: unemployed/sick leave/pension)etc. Its potential applications are to find different depression states to indentify its intensity. We can also look for sleep pattern analysis.

Q.	Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with URL and the author/institute information. Explain briefly about why you like this book.

URL: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf
Author/Institution: W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith, and the R Core Team
	This book caught my interest because I have no experience with the R language and would like to learn more about it. Since I have some experience with Python, I want to see the difference between the two languages. The book title caught my eye because it is self explanatory that the book will provide a good introduction. The “Beginner” tag was also helpful in making sure I didn’t end up reading a book above my experience level.
