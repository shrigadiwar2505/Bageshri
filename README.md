Q.	Introduce the selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub (with the data source URL) and describe its potential applications and values.

URL: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset
Data.gov was launched in 2009 by U.S. General Services Administration, Technology Transformation Service (https://www.data.gov/about). Essentially, research and work done under the U.S. government that can be made public are accessed in Data.gov. Data can be filtered from the following categories:
*Location
*Topics
*Topic Category
*Dataset Type (Geospatial or Non-Geospatial)
*Tags
*Formats (CSV, HTML, etc.)
*Organization Types (Federal, State, City, etc.)
*Organizations
*Publishers
*Bureaus
If you don’t know what data you want, the filters are helpful in finding a data set you may like. Potential applications can range from data synthesizing results from different organizations, publishers, etc. to data analysis of a particular subject in one data set. Another very useful application is finding relevant geospatial data that is available to practice with. 

Q.	Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with URL and the author/institute information. Explain briefly about why you like this book.

URL: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf
Author/Institution: W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith, and the R Core Team
	This book caught my interest because I have no experience with the R language and would like to learn more about it. Since I have some experience with Python, I want to see the difference between the two languages. The book title caught my eye because it is self explanatory that the book will provide a good introduction. The “Beginner” tag was also helpful in making sure I didn’t end up reading a book above my experience level.
